                <h3>About Cold Feet Studio</h3>
                <p>I would like to tell you that each piece of my jewelry is thought out and planned down to the tee, but the truth is that I make it up as I go along. I start out with good intentions to follow a path already drawn, but soon one idea begs for another to follow, and all I can do is resign myself to the unknown and let the games begin. This is what excites me about creating. It is what brings me back to my studio each day. When I write, when I paint, when I make my quilts and pottery, when I do all of these things, I smile inside and things just seem a little lighter. At this point in my life, everything I make from selling my jewelry goes to charity, namely, Save the Children, Care, Oxfam, Heifer International, and Doctors Without Borders. I've also discovered a little school in Kenya which I've decided to include in my giving.</p>

        <h3>Giving Back</h3>
